# Firefighting Activity Recognition

## Introduction

We are the researchers from HCI Lab, from the University of Nottingham Ningbo China

For research purposes, we have collected the Specialized Firefighting Training Associated Activities (SFTAA) dataset that contains 8 activities during firefighting SCBA endurance training performed by 18 firefighters. 

## Commercial Use
The user must only use this dataset for academic research or educational purposes. It is no allowed to use this dataset for any commercial purposes. 

## Dataset Structure
The dataset structure can be found via the file [SFTAA-structure](SFTAA-structure.md).

## Access
If you'd like to access our dataset, please send us your request via e-mail. (boon-giin.lee@nottingham.edu.cn)
