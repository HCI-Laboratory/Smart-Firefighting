# Firefighting Activity Recognition

## Introduction

We are the researchers from HCI Lab, from the University of Nottingham Ningbo China

For research purposes, we have collected the Specialized Firefighting Training Associated Activities (SFTAA) dataset that contains 8 activities during firefighting SCBA endurance training performed by 18 firefighters. 

The dataset structure can be found via the file [SFTAA-structure](SFTAA-structure.md).

If you'd like to access our dataset, please send us your request via e-mail. (boon-giin.lee@nottingham.edu.cn)

If you use the dataset in your own work, please cite our paper. (**Will Update Soon**)
